		<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size="-1">Join the Breyer Little Bits Club today! We 
				offer photo showing, updates on new Little Bit scale models and 
				resins, and much more! This club is open to any one who wishes to show model 
				horses (any make or mold) of the Little Bit scale!</FONT></P>
		<P><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size="2"></FONT>&nbsp;</P>
		
		<P align="left"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">THIS CLUB IS OPEN TO ANY MAKE, 
				MOLD, OR RESIN in Little Bit (or Paddock Pal)&nbsp;scale! The general scale for 
				this club is about 4"-5" high....but that varies, so use your judgement and 
				feel free to ask questions along the way. Sorry, no Donna Chaney resins, since 
				they are considered large SM scale.
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing that adds flavor and 
				interest to our little bit shows&nbsp;is when someone enters a lesser known 
				make of horse. We encourage the showing of all types, makes, and models of 
				horses and other equine (or non-equine) so long as they are *not* stablemate 
				scale or larger than little bit size.&nbsp;<BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to spice up your show 
				string with a lesser known make of horse, be on the safe side. Write the name 
				of the breed on the back as well as its size in real life in inches. It may 
				keep your little horse from being disqualified by a judge who is not familiar 
				with that type of horse. After all, there is more to life than boning up on all 
				the different makes of model horses, right? Right! &nbsp;Little Bit types don't 
				have to be in exact scale, but an &nbsp;appropriate size is appreciated. If you 
				have doubts, check with me and we'll work it out. So keep your eyes open for 
				new and untested types of little bit sized horses.</FONT></P>

					things you're wondering is, "How much does this club cost to join?" Right now, 
					it's free. The only that you have to pay is postage if you plan to show in the 
					paper (snail mail) photo shows. There also free online photo shows. Find out 
					more about the point-only photo shows&nbsp; </FONT></FONT><A href="BLBCphotoshowtrain.htm">

				<FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The BLBC has a Yahoo! 
					Group Listserve, where we can post messages to one another about anything

		<P align="left"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">POINTS</FONT><br>
			<FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
				BLBC has a wonderful pointkeeper who keeps tracks of the points earned by each 
				horse. Not only does a model get points for placing in a BLBC Photo Show 
				(online or mail-in), but a Little-Bit scale horse can also get points from 
				placing in a live show! So be sure to keep Deb the pointkeeper updated with how 
				your LB's are doing in the live show ring.&nbsp;The points are given&nbsp;1st 
				thru 10th (10 points&nbsp;for 1st and 1 point&nbsp;for 10th). A special prize 
				will be given to the LB with the most live show points. So&nbsp;get out and 
				SHOW THOSE LITTLE-BITS!!
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just so you know, the models shown 
				in online photo shows and those shown in paper photo shows will be kept 
				seperate in the point keeping. That is why it is okay for one type to have more 
				shows (monthly mail-in as opposed to bi-monthly online), as it won't be an 
				unfair advantage!</FONT>

					questions you have! I'm happy to help!</FONT>
